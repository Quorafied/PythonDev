#Lisp has jokingly been called "the most intelligent way to misuse a
#computer". I think that description is a great compliment because it
#transmits the full flavor of liberation: it has assisted a number of our
#most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts.

#What Paul does, and does very well, is to take ideas and concepts that
#are beautiful in the abstract, and brings them down to a real world

#Since programmers create programs out of nothing, imagination is our
#only limitation. Thus, in the world of programming, the hero is the one
#who has great vision. Paul Graham is one of our contemporary heroes. He
#has the ability to embrace the vision, and to express it plainly. His
#works are my favorites, especially the ones describing language design.
#He explains secrets of programming, languages, and human nature that can
#only be learned from the hacker experience. This book shows you his
#great vision, and tells you the truth about the nature of hacking.
#-- Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, creator of Ruby

#To follow the path:
#    look to the master,
#    follow the master,
#    walk with the master,
#    see through the master,
#    become the master.
